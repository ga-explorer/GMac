# About GMac

GMac, short for “Geometric Macro“, is a sophisticated .NET based code generation software system that allows implementing geometric models and algorithms based on Geometric Algebra (GA) in arbitrary target programming languages. 

You can download the full GMac source code at: https://github.com/ga-explorer/GMac and you can read the full GMac user guides at: https://gmac-guides.netlify.com

For full instructions on how to install and use GMac you can read the GMac System Guide at http://gmac-guides.netlify.com/index.php/gmac-system-guide/

**The GMac System is currently archived, and replaced by the more powerful Geometric Algebra Fulcrum Library (GA-FuL), which can be found <a href="https://github.com/ga-explorer/GeometricAlgebraFulcrumLib" target="_blank">here</a>**.
